      The City of Thornton has a lot of people in city offices working hard and
      doing a great job assuring the City of Thornton is a great place to live â€“
      and it shows! I want to be a part of that and contribute to the best of my
      ability with whatever knowledge and wisdom I have gained in life. In that
      vein, I will support small businesses over large corporations and I will
      support homeowners and the rent-oppressed over tax avoiders and
      opportunists taking advantage of the system for their own benefit and the
      benefit solely of their bottom lines (selfish developers, venture
      capitalists, and the like). I will defend the expansion of social services
      and mental enhancement resources over exorbitant budgets for law
      enforcement or an increase in jails.
