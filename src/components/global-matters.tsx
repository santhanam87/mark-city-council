      The City of Thornton can do its part to continue to contribute to the
      betterment of the world as a whole through its xeriscaping education,
      community connections resources, recreation programs, parks and planning
      efforts, and active adult centers and programs, and all other programs
      meant to benefit us locally while figuring into the greater calculus
      affecting our state and the global environment… <br />I will do my part to
