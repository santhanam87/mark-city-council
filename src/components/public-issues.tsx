      Above all, I prioritize and will support a healthy environment including
      clear/clean air, clean land, safe water, and thriving clean neighborhoods
      for the enjoyment and healthy life of all inhabitants. I want our city to
      be safe and healthy for my children and yours.
      <br />
      <br /> A steadfast transition to renewable energy and energy conservation
      including strong advocacy of solar panel installation, insulating older
      homes, making use of programs such as GRID Alternatives, Home Energy
      Squad, and other third parties researched and vetted by the city for
      citizens’ use, are all paramount issues I prioritize, advocate and
      support. We will not survive as a species if we do not adjust our
      trajectory going forward.
      <br />
      <br /> Collective power and environmental action to address the climate
      emergency we face as a species, including standing steadfast to assure
      special interests do not take advantage of others and to keep selfishness
      at bay to assure climate justice.
      <br />
      <br /> Water conservation might be the most compelling requirement of the
      future. Many authorities foresee that wars in the future will be fought
      over access to water – unlike wars in the past over gold and other
      precious resources. Water is quickly becoming the number one concern of
      governments. Luckily Thornton had the foresight years ago through City
      Manager Jack Ethredge’s and others’ works. <br />

      We need to honor such efforts by safeguarding the gift we have been given
      and assure such a treasured resource is never wasted. Focus on uniting all
      peoples and inspiring those who are better-off to contribute to helping
      other less-fortunate communities with their concerns. One-for-all citizens
      and all citizens for one unified city! <br />
