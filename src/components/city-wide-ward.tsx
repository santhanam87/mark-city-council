      While each City Council Member is elected to represent the people of their
      individual Ward, most policies and decisions affect us all – the city as a
      whole – and deference to the needs of others sometimes must be given for
      the long-term benefit of the whole. We are all one. I will work in that
      vein to assure the city is united and we all share equally in its wealth,
      its diversity, and assure support of one another in its needs.
