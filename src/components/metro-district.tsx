        Better oversight over the terms granted to Residential Metro District
        Development to better protect/promote the financial interests of
        homeowner taxpayers over developers and corporations. Stop the
        profiteering from infrastructure expenses. Prevent developers from
        pawning off excessive expenses or passing on excessive costs. Better

        home since living in Colorado, and I had a 5th new-build experience when
        my wife and I bought a townhouse for rent by her mother, which we
        ultimately sold. But the first 4 were all before my 5th experience
        moving into a Metro District. What an eye-opening expensive experience.
