        Better regulation can be had simply by better oversight over the terms
        granted to Residential Metro District Development to better
        protect/promote the financial interests of homeowner taxpayers over
        developers and corporations. This is directly in the hands of each city
        whose city council votes to pass the creation of a Metro District. City
        Council can assess whether there is excessive profiteering from
        infrastructure expenses, and help prevent developers from pawning-off
        excessive expenses or passing-on excessive costs in the form of bonds
        left behind by the developer for the homeowners/taxpayers to pay through
        their tax assessments each year. <br />

        What an eye-opening expensive experience when, after four new-build home
        purchases within city-controlled infrastructure developments, to then
        experience moving into a Metro District and being saddled with what
        really can be likened to a “second mortgage” – the participation in
        paying down the debt incurred from the infrastructure and maintenance
        expenses of your localized metro district community because the city
        does not have the financial wherewithal to participate in the way it did
        in the past in building out a community that is part of the overall
        incorporated city (domain).

        Metro Districts are “a controversial tool that Colorado developers use
        to build homes” Homeowners, through their elected City Council Member
        representation, want “to limit the amount of debt that metro districts
        can issue”. (See first link that follows.)
