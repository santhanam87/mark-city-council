      The safety and security of the public and our living environment is
      integral to our existence and livelihood, but not to the detriment of
      social services or funding general welfare and domestic tranquility
      activities and programs, and assuring essentials to a quality life.

      Peace officers are to serve and protect Thornton citizens -- never to
      serve as ‘military’ backup for I.C.E. or other non-Thornton concerns.
      Peace officers should not be militarized or prepared to battle their own
      citizenry when less combative paths exist to enforce the safety and
      security of the city and its population.
      <br />
      <br />
      We must front-load the resources and tools that assure a safe and secure
      populace rather than be required to pick up anyone who has fallen through
      the cracks, presented problems, or otherwise forces corrective action
      requirements when pro-active/preventive policies could be implemented
      beforehand.
