      I have been a participant and contributor to the Horizon High School
      Improvement Team for 10 years, attending regular monthly or bi-monthly
      meetings during the school year. I have maintained this volunteer effort
      beyond my second daughterâ€™s completion of her high school education for
      four years so far, and I look forward to continuing this fall for the
      2025-2026 school year.
