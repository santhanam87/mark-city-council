      Thornton needs fresh new perspectives and input from new sources. Thornton
      needs a new set of tires – not tired re-treads. Thornton does not need
      warmed-up leftovers bringing milk-toast input where a dynamic approach is
      required. On 4 November 2025 vote for MARK GORMLEY to add creativity,
      wide-experience perspectives, and greater balance and stability to the
      oversight you seek on Thornton City Council. The city needs to move into
      the future by handling the new array of challenges presented to it by
      higher government and to approach those challenges with a fresh outlook –
      not by looking in the rearview mirror toward the past!
      <br />
      Please provide me the opportunity to make the City of Thornton’s ride
      smoother with a fresh approach, a fresh perspective, and the creativity of
      new ideas.
