      City streets, city lights, fire department, police, sewers, trash
      collection, city parks and trails, open space, libraries, etc. Those are
      all part of our “Commons”. They are part of our social commitment and
      social contract with one another to serve the society in which we live and
      have decided to partake. The “Commons” are essential to life and are to be
      shared between us all and suitably maintained.
      <br />
      <br />I will champion the bolstering of such Commons while helping to
      assure an equitable budget and funds distribution among them all to
      further assure civic, environmental, and community health within and
      throughout the City of Thornton.

      Control to assure fairness and equity for all.
